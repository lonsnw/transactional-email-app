# Mewsletter app

This is a very simple app built to test adding recipients to a MailChimp newsletter using the MailChimp marketing API.

The app is built using HTML and JavaScript.  I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gjk25N7WFkI) and adjusted as needed to hide the API key and to make changes as needed for the updates that MailChimp has made.

I did not ultimately use the MailChimp library, though I did install it.

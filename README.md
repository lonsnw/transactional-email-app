# momentary paws app

This is a very simple app built to test sending an inspirational HTML email using the MailChimp transactional API.

The app is built using HTML and JavaScript.  I built on the [MailChimp marketing app I built](https://github.com/lonsnw/mailchimp-app) and used the MailChimp docs to use the transactional API instead of the marketing API used in the newsletter app.

I did not ultimately use the MailChimp library, though I did install it.
